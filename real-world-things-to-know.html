          <p>A place we all find ourselves in along our learning journey is trying to get to a point where we can actually write useful programs, those beyond little scripts that change
            file names, or print things to the terminal screen. It's hard to continue learning if you aren't sure what prjects to do, and while other peoples lists of beginner or
            intermediate projects are useful, its the ones that directly impact your own world or your current job, that have you searching for solutions and overcoming problems.
            And thats what learning is.
          </p>

          <p>Here are a few things that I leanred myself that helped me understand how to write useful programs pertinent to me, and kept me moving forward on my learning journey.</p>

          <h2 class="section-heading">API's and how to integrate</h2>

          <p>If you intend to go anywhere near the web then getting to grips with how an API works is essential. Learning how connect and extract data using Python is a great way to
            utilise an API and transform your programs
          </p>

          <p>An API is basically how programs talk to each other. We can send a request (the simplest being a GET request) over HTTP and request information, and get sent data back.
            Think about a weather API. We could send a request for the weather in London now, and recieve back that information instantly. Or we could request the weather for tomorrow,
            and so on. This might not be useful for us as is, but you could combine that information with something else and produce a result useful to you in someway.
          </p>

          <p>There are hundreds of APIs available to you, lots free and some not. There's a music lyrics API, a Chuck Norris quotes API, Country information and even some games
            like Heartstone have an API to extract data.
          </p>

          <h2 class="section-heading">JSON data</h2>

          <p>The data standard for API and web data is JSON, making this a vital thing to learn to work with. You can use the build in JSON Python library to parse the information
            and extract what you need. 
          </p>

          <blockquote class="blockquote">The dreams of yesterday are the hopes of today and the reality of tomorrow. Science has not yet mastered prophecy. We predict too much for the next year and yet far too little for the next ten.</blockquote>

          <p>Spaceflights cannot be stopped. This is not the work of any one man or even a group of men. It is a historical process which mankind is carrying out in accordance with the natural laws of human development.</p>

          <h2 class="section-heading">Reaching for the Stars</h2>

          <p>As we got further and further away, it [the Earth] diminished in size. Finally it shrank to the size of a marble, the most beautiful you can imagine. That beautiful, warm, living object looked so fragile, so delicate, that if you touched it with a finger it would crumble and fall apart. Seeing this has to change a man.</p>

          <span class="caption text-muted">To go places and do things that have never been done before – that’s what living is all about.</span>

          <p>Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its five-year mission: to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no man has gone before.</p>

          <p>As I stand out here in the wonders of the unknown at Hadley, I sort of realize there’s a fundamental truth to our nature, Man must explore, and this is exploration at its greatest.</p>
